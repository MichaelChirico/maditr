Description: Package provides pipe-friendly interface for 'data.table'. It preserves all
     'data.table' features without significant impact on performance. For example,
     you can write 'mtcars %>% take(mean(mpg), by = am)' for aggregation or 'mtcars
     %>% let(hp_wt = hp/wt, hp_wt_mpg = hp_wt/mpg)' for modification. Use
     'take_if/let_if' for conditional aggregation/modification. 'query_if'
     translates its arguments one-to-one to 'data.table'. Additionally there are
     some conveniences such as automatic 'data.frame' conversion to 'data.table'.
